# Robustness-in-image-classification

This repository contains the report and the code for experiments that we made with Vincent Bardusco Project made with Vincent Bardusco in a project for the MVA course Geometric Data Analysis (https://www.jeanfeydy.com/Teaching/index.html).
The goal is to study the robustness of image classifiers by analyzing the geometry and topology of decision regions, based on the three following articles:
